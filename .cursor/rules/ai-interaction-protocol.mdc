critique (string): The feedback text.

cropCoordinates (object): An object with x, y, width, and height properties.

dribbbleKeywords (string): Keywords for the Dribbble API search.

Backend Validation: The backend must validate the structure of the JSON response from the AI before processing it or sending it to the client.
